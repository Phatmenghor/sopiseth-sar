        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sar Sopiseth, a senior UX UI Designer at a
        startup project, and I juggle roles as an instructor and consultant at
        Future.bit, the pioneering UX UI design school. Over the past 2-3 years,
        I've evolved from a marketing designer executive to a UX UI designer,
        mastering skills essential for grasping both business and design
        perspectives. My project scope includes mobile app and responsive web
        designs for diverse sectors like e-Agriculture, eCommerce, discovery,
        and business landing pages. With a core focus on UX, I intricately
        analyze user behavior to ensure every design decision caters to the
        needs of non-technical users, especially farmers. Collaborating closely
        with cross-functional teams, including CEOs, PMs, and leads, I ensure
        each design aligns seamlessly with business goals and user satisfaction.
